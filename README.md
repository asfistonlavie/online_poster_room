# Online Poster Room

The Online Poster Room is a virtual room on a web page that displays posters
poster thumbnails with links to full poster and a meeting room. This application
has been initially developped for JOBIM 2020 bioinformatics conference as the
event has been turned into a virtual form due to COVID-19.

## Getting Started

Download or clone the project. Only 3 files are used: poster_room.js,
poster_room.css and poster_room.json. These files should be made accessible to
the clients of the poster room.
* poster_room.js: contains the Javascript code use to generate the room;
* poster_room.css: contains the CSS code used to display the room well;
* poster_room.json: contains the poster room configuration and poster data.

### Prerequisites

The Online Poster Room requires jQuery > 1.7 to generate the poster room. Then,
poster thumbnails should be generated by a third party application. Finally,
poster meeting rooms are managed by an external application such as Jitsi Meet
(https://meet.jit.si/).

### Installing

To use the online poster room, you must have the files poster_room.js,
poster_room.css and poster_room.json accessible through the web by poster room
clients and you will have to create a web page with a code similar to the
following one:

```
```

If you use a CMS and have restricted access to the HTML header, you can try the
following (assuming jQuery is available):

```
<div id="jobim_poster_browser">&nbsp;</div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://your.site.web/path_to/poster_room.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[
// Add style sheet.
var css = "https://your.site.web/path_to/poster_room.css";
$.get(css, function(data) {
  $("<style type=\"text/css\">" + data + "</style>").appendTo(document.head);
});
// Init settings.
var jobim = {poster_show: true, lang: 'en'};
// Get data.
$.getJSON("/path_to/poster_room.json", function(json) {
  jobim = json;
});
// Start room.
$(function () {
  jobim_init_poster_room(jobim);
});
// ]]></script>
```
